# üåç Influencer Discovery & Cross-Platform Matching Pipeline

This project automates the **discovery of influencers** by searching for Instagram profiles using Google Search, validating them based on follower counts, and finding matching profiles across **YouTube, TikTok, and X (Twitter)**.  
All discovered usernames are then stored in a **PostgreSQL database** for further analysis or business intelligence workflows.

##  Overview

### Pipeline Flow

1. **Keyword-based discovery**  
   Uses Google Search (`site:instagram.com`) to find public Instagram profiles related to specific keywords (e.g., *comedian, blogger, fashion, artist*).

2. **Follower extraction & filtering**  
   Parses search snippets and estimates follower counts using pattern recognition (e.g., `2.5M followers ‚Üí 2500000`).

3. **Cross-platform enrichment**  
   For each valid Instagram username:
   - YouTube: Searches for `site:youtube.com/@username`
   - TikTok: Searches for `site:tiktok.com/@username`
   - X (Twitter): Visits `x.com/{username}` to verify handle existence

4. **Data persistence**  
   Results are saved to a PostgreSQL database table `username_search`, containing:
